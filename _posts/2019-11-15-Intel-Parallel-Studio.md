Intel Parallel Studio XE is a [software](https://python-software.github.io/Eric-Software) development product developed by Intel that facilitates native code development on Windows, macOS and Linux in C++ and Fortran for parallel computing. Parallel [programming](https://python-software.github.io/Core-Python-Programming) enables software programs to take advantage of multi-core processors from Intel and other processor vendors. Parallel Studio is composed of several component parts, each of which is a collection of capabilities. • Intel Advisor - specialized performance profiler to optimize vectorization and a thread prototyping system for adding / improving threading.

• Intel VTune Amplifier (formerly VTune Performance Analyzer) is a performance profiler that analyzes hotspots, concurrency, locks-and-waits, memory access, and storage. • Intel MPI Library – a multi-fabric message passing library that implements the Message Passing Interface specification across Intel platforms • Intel Trace Analyzer and Collector - a graphical tool for understanding MPI application behavior, finding bottlenecks and errors in parallel cluster applications based on Intel architecture • Intel Cluster Checker – Prepackaged checks to diagnose cluster health, functionality and performance. They are accessible via API to embed capabilities into applications. • Intel [Distribution](https://python-software.github.io/Anaconda-Python-Distribution) for Python – a Python distribution using Intel Performance libraries to boost performance of NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, Pandas (software) and other packages. Intel announced Parallel Studio during their Intel Developer Forum in August 2008 along with a web site to sign up for their open beta program.

On 26 May 2009, Intel announced that it had released the product to market. Intel and Microsoft worked togetherto make their products compatible by adopting a common runtime called the Microsoft Concurrency Runtime, which is part of Visual Studio 2010. .
